       /* //operators: 
       befor understanding operator first understansd operand:
         operand= entities in which operators operate 
         example: 3+5=8 ( in this example the 3 and 5 are operand and the plus sign(+) is operator)
         some operators are :
        
         1: unary operator: 
        it has single operand 
        example x=-x (in which only one operator which is "x")

        2: binary: it has more then one operands.
        example: a=b+c

        3: Arithmatic operators:
        arithmatic operators are : plus(+),negative(-),divide(/),multiply(*),modulas(% which mean reminder of any division),exponention(**),increment(++),decrement(--)

        4: Assignment operators:
        asssignment operators are: (=),(+=),(*=),(**=)

        5: String operators:
        the plus(+) operator can also be used for concatenation string.

        6:Comparision Operators:
        Comparision operators are: equal to(==),equal value and equal type(===),not equal(!=),grater then and equal(>=),ternary operator (?).

        7: Logical operators:
        AND(&&),OR(||),NOT(!)

        8: type operator:
        1: typeof(return the type of variable )
        2: instanceof(instance of an object type)

        9: bidwise Operator:

// some programs practices using operators:


 let a=7;       
let b=7;
let d=4;
c=a+b;
d+=b;  //we can also write d=d+b;
console.log(c);
console.log(d);
console.log(a++);
console.log(a+b);
console.log(a--);
console.log(a+=b);
